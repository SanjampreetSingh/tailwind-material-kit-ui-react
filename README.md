# Tailwind + Material UI

This is a small effort to make Material 3 design (UI kit by Google) based react component library with Tailwind under the hood.

## Reason for it's existence

Previously, working on large project with custom UI themes and using Material UI (MUI) as a component library, I and my team mates had faced a number of issues of code duplication on CSS side of things, some times overriding the current style sheet and breaking things on the go. Eventually, having us to go over the commits and finding the problems.

Tailwind is a good solution for this but adding it to current MUI doesn't feel right. So, I have decided to build a component library that mimics MUI but is built on Tailwind CSS. Also since, I plan to keep it open source and free, I would like people to help by contributing on here.
